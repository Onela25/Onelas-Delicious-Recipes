        Ingredients
        4 medium to medium-large russet potatoes (about 10 ounces each)
        1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
        1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more for serving
        Freshly ground black pepper, unsalted butter, shredded sharp cheddar, sour cream, and/or scallions, for serving (as
        desired)
    <br />
       Serve:
       Remove the potatoes from the air fryer with a pair of tongs. Using a sharp knife, slice each potato through the top
       lengthwise (without cutting all the way through) to reveal the steamy interior.
    
       Use a fork to fluff the insides of the potato. Season and top as desired with more salt, freshly ground black pepper,
       unsalted butter, shredded sharp cheddar, sour cream, and/or scallions. Serve immediately while the insides are still hot
       and the skin is still crispy.
